# FAT-filesystem-reader
A simple FAT12/16 driver, because why not (and I will also need it for my OS development activities). Still unfinished, but it can do... things

**Current state**:  
It can read root and first-level folders/files. Implementing arbitrary levels from here on is pretty easy, but when to find free time for this... It is in a very messy state currently. I still need to clean it after prototyping phase
